import React, { Component } from 'react'
class Welcome extends Component {
    // class to become component we need to extend it to component class from react
    //second thing is we need to define render method which returns html
    render() {
        return <h1>Class Component</h1>
    }
}
export default Welcome;
// they require ; at the end of the statement unlike the functional component for eg Greet.js
